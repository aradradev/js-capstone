2. Episode Guides: Users can access episode guides for TV shows, which include summaries, air dates, and guest appearances. This helps users stay up-to-date with their favorite shows and ensures they don't miss any episodes.

3. Personalized Tracking: The app allows users to create personalized watchlists and track their progress for each TV show. They can mark episodes as watched, track their viewing history, and receive notifications for upcoming episodes.

4. Ratings and Reviews: Users can rate and review TV shows, sharing their opinions and recommendations with others. This feature helps users discover popular shows and make informed decisions about what to watch.

5. Recommendations: The app provides personalized recommendations based on users' viewing history, ratings, and preferences. It suggests new shows that users might enjoy, helping them discover content tailored to their tastes.

6. Social Interaction: Users can engage with other TV fans through comments, discussions, and forums. They can share their thoughts, participate in conversations, and connect with like-minded individuals who share their passion for TV shows.
